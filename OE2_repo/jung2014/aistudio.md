This review provides a comprehensive overview of organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), covering their historical background, fundamental optoelectronic and dielectric properties, working principles, various device structures, and preparation methods for high efficiency. It highlights the rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to over 19% by 2014 and discusses the attributes (high absorption, balanced charge transport, long diffusion lengths) contributing to this performance. The paper also addresses the potential for flexible PSCs and the critical challenges related to long-term stability and lead toxicity, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms for further improvement and commercialization.

### **2. Key Topics & Important Points**

#### **A. Historical Background of Organometal Halide Perovskites**
*   **Discovery:** Organometal halide perovskites (CH3NH3MX3, M=Pb or Sn, X=Cl, Br or I) first reported by Weber in 1978 for their structure and physical properties.
*   **Early PV Attempts:** First attempt to use CH3NH3PbX3 as a semiconductor sensitizer in dye-sensitized liquid junction solar cells in 2009 yielded low PCEs (3-4%) and extreme instability due to liquid electrolytes.
*   **Breakthrough:** Park's group reported a 6.5% efficient CH3NH3PbI3 PSC with improved stability in electrolytes. The "trigger" for PSC research was the 2012 discovery of a **9.7% solid-state perovskite solar cell with 500 hours confirmed stability**, overcoming the liquid electrolyte dissolution problem.
*   **Rapid Efficiency Growth (Fig. 1, page 1):** From 3.8% in 2009 to 19.3% in 2014, demonstrating rapid progress.

#### **B. Basic Fundamentals of Organometal Halide Perovskites**
1.  **Madelung Constant and Lattice Energy:**
    *   Madelung constant (M) for cubic perovskite A+1B+2(X-1)3 relates to lattice energy.
    *   Low lattice energy indicates that low energy is required to separate perovskite into ions and form it from ions, implying strong ionic characteristics.
    *   This strong ionic characteristic makes PSCs sensitive to polarization in an electric field.
2.  **Phase Transition and Its Origin:**
    *   Methylammonium (MA = CH3NH3+) based halide perovskites undergo **structural phase transitions with temperature** (cubic → tetragonal → orthorhombic upon cooling).
    *   This is due to the molecular motion and orientational disorder of the MA cation (Fig. 1, page 4).
    *   MA ions influence Pb-I bond length, angle, and bandgap, affecting geometry stability and electronic structure.
3.  **Band Position and Bandgap Tuning (Fig. 2, page 4):**
    *   **Absorption Coefficient:** High (1.5x10^4 cm^-1 at 550 nm), similar to GaAs, CdTe, CIGS. Penetration depth for 550nm light is ~0.66 µm.
    *   **Bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3:** 1.50-1.55 eV, but wider absorption (panchromatic) is needed.
    *   **Bandgap Tuning Strategies:**
        *   **A-site Cation Modification:** Replacing MA with formamidinium (FA) reduces bandgap by ~0.07 eV (extends absorption by ~40 nm).
        *   **M-X Bond Modification (B-site Metal/Halide):** Partially replacing Pb2+ with Sn2+ in CH3NH3PbI3 reduces bandgap from 1.55 eV to 1.17 eV. This influences VBM and CBM (s-antibonding states of Pb 6s and I 5p for VBM; Pb 6p and I 5s for CBM).
        *   **Halide Mixing:** Changing halides (Cl, Br, I) modifies bandgap.
    *   **Pb- vs. Sn-based Perovskites:** Both are promising. Pb-based (CH3NH3PbI3, FAPbI3) generally show higher absorption coefficients, though computational studies sometimes suggest Sn-based (CH3NH3SnI3) can be higher.
4.  **Dielectric and Electrical Properties (Fig. 3, page 5):**
    *   **Dielectric Permittivity (ε'):** Higher in tetragonal phase (180-300 K) than orthorhombic (lower temperatures). Increases with larger halide anion (Cl < Br < I).
    *   **Polarization:** Electronic, ionic, and orientational polarization (from permanent electric dipoles of MA+ ions). Giant dielectric constants (approaching 10^7) observed under illumination, linked to MA+ molecular orientation.
    *   **Electrical Conductivity:** Sn-based perovskites (CsSnBr3, CH3NH3SnI3) show high electrical conductivity due to infinite linear -I-Sn-I-Sn- chains. Decreases upon replacement of Cs and Sn by CH3NH3 and Pb.

#### **C. Working Principle and Device Structures (Fig. 4, page 5)**
*   **General Solar Cell Processes:** Light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, charge collection.
*   **P-I-N vs. P-N Junction:** Light harvester as intrinsic semiconductor requires p-i-n. If n-type/p-type, p-n junction. Organometal perovskites have balanced charge transport properties suitable for both.
*   **Charge Diffusion Lengths:** Crucial for high efficiency. Reported values vary greatly (100 nm to >1 µm) depending on preparation method (crystallinity, grain size). Longer for holes than electrons in some cases. Electron transport layer (ETL) design is vital to compensate for shorter electron diffusion length.
*   **Electron/Hole Mobility:** High (25 cm²/Vs) and balanced, remaining high on microsecond timescales.
*   **Typical Structures:**
    *   **Mesoscopic Nanostructure (Fig. 4a):** Perovskite dots adsorbed on TiO2 surface (similar to dye-sensitized solar cells working principle). Electrons collected via TiO2.
    *   **Planar Structure (Fig. 4b):** Without mesoporous TiO2 layer.
*   **Performance Comparison (Mesoscopic vs. Planar):** Initially, mesoscopic was more efficient. Later studies found planar structures could be more efficient due to better charge transport and lower recombination, despite lower diffusion length and lower recombination resistance in mesoscopic structures.
*   **Interface Engineering:** Critical for charge transport and recombination control. MgO nanolayers, PEIE modification of ITO, polyelectrolyte intermediate layers, wide bandgap ETLs.
*   **HTM-Free Structures:** Possible due to perovskite's hole transporting properties. Requires thick, smooth perovskite layer to avoid shunts. Triple layer HTM-free mesoscopic PSCs (TiO2/ZrO2/C) achieved 12.8% PCE, with ZrO2 blocking electron flow to back contact.
*   **HTM Materials:** Spiro-MeOTAD is common. Polymeric HTMs (P3HT, PTAA) and inorganic HTMs (NiO, CuI, CuSCN) are also suitable.

#### **D. Preparation Methods for High Efficiency PSCs**
1.  **Solution Process: One-Step Versus Two-Step Coatings (Fig. 5, page 8)**
    *   **One-step:** Spin-coating mixed CH3NH3I and PbI2 solution (in DMF, GBL, DMSO).
    *   **Two-step:** First coat PbI2, then spin-coat CH3NH3I solution.
    *   **Morphology Control:** Two-step coating often yields better morphology (cuboid-like crystals) and interfaces, leading to better photovoltaic performance than one-step (shapeless morphology).
    *   **Crystal Size Control (Fig. 6, page 8 & Fig. 7, page 9):** CH3NH3I concentration in two-step method affects crystal size (e.g., 0.038M: ~700nm, 0.063M: ~90nm). Larger crystals from lower concentrations show higher Jsc (better light harvesting and charge extraction), but Voc does not necessarily increase with crystal size.
    *   **Solvent Engineering:** Using mixed solvents (γ-butyrolactone, DMSO, toluene drop-casting) and chlorobenzene treatment to control crystallization and morphology, achieving uniform, dense films with large grains (16.2% certified PCE). Additives like NH4Cl also improve crystallinity.
2.  **Vacuum Process:**
    *   **Thermal Evaporation:** Co-evaporation of CH3NH3I and PbCl2 (or PbI2). Better for thickness control. Requires high vacuum, restricting cost-effectiveness and mass production.
    *   **Vapor-Assisted Solution Process (VASP):** Grows perovskite films via in situ reactions of PbI2 film with CH3NH3I vapor. Yields well-defined grain structure, full surface coverage, and small roughness.
    *   **Uniformity (Fig. 9, page 10):** Vapor deposition and solution processing (with solvent engineering) can achieve comparable uniformity.

#### **E. Photoluminescence (PL) and Polarization Characteristics**
*   **PL Basics:** Provides information on bandgap, chemical purity, and charge separation. Radiative relaxation (PL) occurs after electronic excitations.
*   **PL Spectra (Fig. 10, page 11):**
    *   Lead-based (CH3NH3PbI3, FAPbI3) show PL between 750-850 nm.
    *   FAPbI3 is red-shifted compared to CH3NH3PbI3.
    *   CH3NH3SnI3 shows red-shifts and broader peaks due to smaller bandgap.
    *   PL peak shifts with MA/FA ratio (solid solution formation) and halide substitution (bandgap increase from iodide to bromide).
*   **PL Quenching (Fig. 11, page 11):** Used to investigate charge separation. Decrease in PL intensity in contact with electron/hole acceptors (e.g., PCBM, spiro-MeOTAD) indicates efficient charge injection. CuSCN shows superior charge separation efficiency compared to NiO.
*   **Impedance Spectroscopy:** Gives insights into carrier transport, recombination, diffusion length.
    *   **Arcs in Impedance Plot (Fig. 12, page 12):**
        *   High-frequency: Selective contacts.
        *   Intermediate-frequency: Chemical capacitance.
        *   Low-frequency: Polarization (due to dipole/domain alignment to external electric field), related to I-V hysteresis.
    *   **Hysteresis Dependence:** Strongly dependent on perovskite crystal size and presence of mp-TiO2 film (large crystals and mp-TiO2 suppress hysteresis).

#### **F. Perovskite Suitable for Flexible Solar Cells (Fig. 14, page 13)**
*   **Attractiveness:** Low-temperature processing (<150°C), all-solid-state nature, high efficiency, light weight, bendability, and shape changeability.
*   **Structures:** N-I-P (ETM/perovskite/HTM) and P-I-N (HTM/perovskite/ETM).
*   **Low-Temperature ETM:** Conventional TiO2 deposition requires high temperature (~400°C), so alternative low-temp methods (e.g., ALD for TiOx compact layer, low-temp ZnO ETL) are used for flexible substrates (e.g., PET).
*   **Mechanical Endurance (Fig. 14b):** Flexible PSC with TiOx compact layer via ALD shows superior mechanical endurance, maintaining efficiency after 1000 bending cycles at 10 mm radius.

#### **G. Long-Term Stability**
*   **Key Issue:** Not well understood; crucial for commercialization.
*   **Degradation Mechanism:** Efforts to improve stability are ongoing.
*   **P3HT polymer HTM:** Shows superior thermal and moisture stability compared to spiro-MeOTAD. PCE drop of 20% after 80°C heating (temp coefficient ~0.33%/°C), similar to CIGS.
*   **Encapsulation:** Hydrophobic PMMA improves waterproof property.
*   **HTM-free, triple layer PSCs:** (TiO2/ZrO2/C scaffold, 10 µm carbon back contact) showed excellent stability over 1008 hours under AM 1.5.

#### **H. Summary and Outlook**
*   **Historical Progress:** Rapid PCE increase, understanding fundamentals (optical absorption, charge transport, PL, impedance).
*   **Fabrication Impact:** Solution and vacuum processes influence crystal growth and morphology.
*   **Flexible PSCs:** Low-temperature processing, solid-state nature, high efficiency, and extraordinary bending durability make them suitable for wearable devices.
*   **Commercialization Challenges:**
    1.  **Pb Toxicity:** Restricts use of Pb-based materials due to intrinsic toxicity. Need Pb-free absorbers and protection technology (e.g., encapsulation) for Pb-based devices.
    2.  **Long-Term Stability:** 1000h operation time guaranteed so far is not enough. Need >20-year lifetime. Requires understanding degradation mechanisms, new materials, and external encapsulation.
    3.  **Cost-effectiveness:** High throughput, reproducible materials/processes.
*   **Future Directions:** Realize >20-year lifetime, develop cost-effective, high-throughput processes, and enhance mechanical functionalities (flexibility, stretchability).
