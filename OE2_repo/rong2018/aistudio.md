### **1. Executive Summary / Main Purpose of the Paper**
This review paper summarizes the rapid progress in Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs), highlighting their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low-cost materials, and simple fabrication. The central theme revolves around the two critical challenges hindering PSC commercialization: **stability** and **manufacturing upscaling**. The paper reviews device configurations, strategies to improve stability, and advances in large-area module fabrication, concluding with an outlook on future directions and necessary standardization.

### **2. Key Topics & Important Points**

#### **A. Background of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs)**
*   **Definition:** PSCs are a type of solar cell that uses a perovskite-structured compound (typically AMX3, where A is an organic cation like methylammonium or formamidinium, M is lead or tin, and X is a halide anion like iodide or bromide) as the light-harvesting active layer.
*   **Attraction:**
    *   Ever-increasing **Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE)**.
    *   **Low-cost materials** constituents.
    *   Simple **solution fabrication process**.
*   **Efficiency Milestones:**
    *   Initiated in 2009 with 3.8% efficiency.
    *   Achieved lab-scale PCE of **23.3%** by 2018, rivaling commercial multicrystalline silicon solar cells, as well as CIGS and CdTe thin-film solar cells.
*   **Core Challenges for Commercialization:**
    *   **Stability:** Maintaining performance over long durations under various environmental stressors.
    *   **Upscaling:** Manufacturing large-area modules efficiently and uniformly.

#### **B. Device Configurations and Performance (Fig. 1B)**
PSCs have a layered structure including a TCO-coated glass substrate, electron-transport layer (ETL), perovskite absorber layer, hole-transport layer (HTL), and a back-contact.
*   **Common Architectures:**
    *   **Mesoscopic (formal n-i-p and inverted p-i-n):** Perovskite sensitizes a mesoporous metal oxide scaffold (e.g., meso-TiO2).
    *   **Planar (formal n-i-p and inverted p-i-n):** Perovskite layer sandwiched between planar ETL and HTL.
    *   **Triple Mesoscopic:** Uses a triple-layer scaffold (mesoporous TiO2, ZrO2 spacer, carbon electrode) and carbon electrodes to replace noble metal back-contacts, often HTM-free.
    *   **Tandem Structures:** PSCs used as top cells with existing PV technologies (e.g., silicon, CIGS, low-bandgap perovskites) to boost efficiency beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit.
*   **Efficiency vs. Area:**
    *   Small-area devices (e.g., ~0.1 cm²) show rapid efficiency advances.
    *   Enlarging device area typically leads to a **decrease in PCE** due to challenges in uniform film fabrication.
*   **Fabrication Methods for Upscaling:** Screen printing, slot-die coating, spray coating, and soft-cover coating are being developed for intermediate-sized modules.
*   **Challenges in Large-Area Modules:**
    *   **Ohmic loss:** Due to resistance from front transparent electrodes (e.g., FTO films). Solutions include increasing thickness (reduces transparency) or depositing conductive grids/interconnected unit cells.
    *   **Geometrical Fill Factor (GFF):** Improved by enlarging module area to reduce dead area associated with edges.

#### **C. Stability of PSCs (Fig. 2 & Fig. 3)**
This is a major hurdle for commercialization.
*   **Lack of Standardized Testing:** A significant challenge is the use of nonstandard testing protocols across the PSC community.
*   **Degradation Factors & Solutions:**
    1.  **Chemical Instability (Charge-Transporting Materials & Interfaces):**
        *   **Problem:** TiO2-based ETL causes photocatalytic degradation under UV. Organic HTMs (spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT, PTAA) suffer from thermal or moisture instability when doped. Metal electrodes (Au, Ag, Al) corrode or diffuse.
        *   **Solutions:**
            *   Replace TiO2 with UV-stable materials (e.g., BaSnO3).
            *   Insert interfacial modifiers (e.g., CsBr, Sb2S3, Cl atoms).
            *   Substitute organic HTMs with inorganic materials.
            *   Introduce buffer layers between perovskite and HTM.
            *   Use unreactive ITO electrodes with barrier layers to prevent moisture/volatile components.
            *   Proper encapsulation.
    2.  **Perovskite Absorber Stability:**
        *   **Problem:** 3D perovskites are susceptible to moisture and light soaking.
        *   **Solutions (Fig. 3):**
            *   **Low-dimensional perovskites (e.g., 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites):** Replacing some cations with large organic ligands improves stability against moisture and light soaking, but can impede charge transfer and sacrifice efficiency.
            *   **Tuning dimensionality:** Enhances stability by leveraging hydrophobicity of large cations.
            *   **Protecting interfaces and grain boundaries:** Small-molecule additives (thiophene, pyridine, urea, PC61BM) and quaternary ammonium halides slow decomposition.
    3.  **Operational Stressors:**
        *   **Light-induced degradation.**
        *   **Potential-induced degradation (PID):** Ion migration and charge accumulation in PSCs contribute to PID, which needs to be suppressed.
        *   **Partial-shade stress:** PSCs have lower reverse-bias breakdown than silicon cells, leading to local heating and decomposition. Bypass diodes may help.
        *   **Mechanical shock/Thermal cycling:** Perovskites have low fracture energy and high thermal expansion coefficients compared to glass/TCOs, leading to delamination. Encapsulants with moderate Young's modulus (e.g., EVA) can relieve strain.
*   **Progress in Stability:**
    *   Printable triple mesoscopic PSCs exhibited lifetimes of 10,000 hours under 1 sun illumination (equivalent to 10 years outdoor use in Europe).
    *   Demonstrated acceptable stability in thermal tests (85-100°C for 2160 hours) and outdoor tests.
*   **Need for Standardization:** Adopt well-established standards (IEC 61215/61646) from mature PVs and develop new protocols for PSC-specific reliability testing.

#### **D. Upscaling and Future Applications**
*   **Commercial Manufacturing Efforts:** Several PV companies are actively manufacturing large-area PSC modules.
    *   **Microquanta Semiconductor (China):** Achieved 17.4% PCE for a rigid perovskite mini-module (17.8 cm²).
    *   **Solliance (Netherlands):** Developed 169 cm² modules with 10% total efficiency using laser ablation, compatible with flexible substrates and roll-to-roll processes.
    *   **Saule Technologies (Poland):** Used inkjet printing for flexible modules with free-form patterns.
    *   **Oxford PV (UK):** Announced a record-certified PCE of 27.3% for 1-cm² perovskite-Si tandem solar cells.
    *   **WonderSolar (China):** Launched a 110-m² perovskite PV system with screen-printed triple mesoscopic PSC modules (3600 cm² each).
*   **Challenges in Large-Scale Manufacturing:**
    *   **Morphology Control:** Difficult to obtain uniform perovskite thin films using solution- or vacuum-based deposition at large scales (ion migration, inhomogeneous crystallization, pinholes).
    *   **Solvent Toxicity:** Solvents used for fabrication are often toxic.
    *   **Lead Toxicity:** Lead in PSCs is more soluble in water than naturally occurring lead and can move into the biogeochemical cycle.
*   **Solutions for Manufacturing & Environmental Concerns:**
    *   Optimize slot-die coating and crystallization processes.
    *   Develop solvent-free deposition methods and low-toxicity reagents.
    *   Use rigorous enclosures and recycling/tail-gas-treating units.
    *   Explore replacing lead with non-toxic elements (Pb-free PSCs).
    *   Develop additives to convert water-soluble lead compounds into insoluble complexes.
    *   **Recycling:** Essential for lead-containing PSCs. Lessons from CdTe PV industry, proposed methods include removing layers with adhesive tape, immersion in solvents, and reusing device scaffolds.
*   **Life Cycle Assessment:** Needed to evaluate materials, production processes, and environmental impacts thoroughly.

#### **E. Outlook / Perspective**
*   **Current State:** PSCs offer low materials cost and short energy payback time (<0.22 years).
*   **Main Goal:** Achieve **long-term stability at the module level** and **durable outdoor operation**.
*   **Future Directions:**
    *   Develop consensus on stability measurement protocols and standardized testing.
    *   Address degradation from illumination and heat through stable materials and interfaces.
    *   Focus on **compositional engineering** to maximize formation energies.
    *   Utilize **machine learning algorithms and robotized synthesis**.
    *   Minimize the efficiency gap between lab cells and industrial modules.
    *   Achieve **low production cost** through low-cost raw materials and simple processing for commercial competitiveness.
