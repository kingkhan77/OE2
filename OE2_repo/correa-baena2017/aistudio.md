### **1. Executive Summary / Main Purpose of the Paper**
This review paper highlights the rapid increase in Perovskite Solar Cell (PSC) efficiencies to over 22% in a few years. It emphasizes that the current focus has shifted from initial efficiency gains to **improving open-circuit voltage (Voc)** through better charge-selective contacts and longer carrier lifetimes, and crucially, addressing **long-term device stability**. The paper delves into device photophysics, material instabilities (like halide segregation and ionic movement), extrinsic degradation factors, and the critical need for robust testing protocols to accelerate commercialization.

### **2. Key Topics & Important Points**

#### **A. Background and Introduction**
*   **Rapid Progress:** PSCs have seen a remarkable increase in PCE from single digits to a certified 22.1% (by 2016), rivalling CdTe solar cells.
*   **Core Challenges:** Despite high efficiencies, long-term durability and the ability to compete with established PV technologies (like crystalline silicon with 25-year warranties) remain the key hurdles.
*   **Focus Areas:** The paper emphasizes improving Voc (as Jsc is near theoretical maximum) and enhancing long-term stability by understanding and counteracting intrinsic and extrinsic degradation mechanisms.

#### **B. Device Configurations (Fig. 1 A-D)**
*   **ABX3 Structure:** A-site (organic MA, FA, or inorganic Cs, Rb), B-site (Pb, Sn), X-site (halides I, Br, Cl).
*   **Basic Structure:** TCO glass substrate, electron-selective (ETL), perovskite absorber, hole-selective (HTL), metal contact.
*   **Common Architectures:**
    *   **Mesoporous (n-i-p):** Thick alumina/titania nanoparticle films infiltrated with perovskite (e.g., MAPbI3). Initially most efficient, but requires high-temperature sintering, limiting flexible substrates. More recent advances reduced film thickness to 200nm perovskite layer (yielded >16%).
    *   **Planar (n-i-p and p-i-n / inverted):** Omits mesoporous layer, often low-temperature processing. Depending on contact sequence (n-i-p: FTO/ETL/Perovskite/HTL/Metal; p-i-n: FTO/HTL/Perovskite/ETL/Metal).
    *   **Perovskite Tandems (Multijunction):** Stacking two bandgap-matched absorbers (e.g., Si/perovskite or perovskite/perovskite) to exceed single-junction Shockley-Queisser limit. Challenges include orthogonal solvents for deposition; vacuum processing or protective ITO layers are explored.

#### **C. State-of-the-Art Devices & Efficiency (Fig. 1E)**
*   **Breakthroughs:** PCEs >20% reported since 2015, reaching a certified 22.1% (highest reported by iodide addition, which reduces deep-level traps).
*   **Compositional Engineering:** Tailoring MA, FA, I, Br proportions to improve electronic properties. Rb, Cs, MA, FA as cations, Pb as B-site, I and Br as X-site have led to high efficiencies.
*   **Device Metrics:** Short-circuit currents (Jsc) and fill factors (FF) are near maximum. The main focus for further efficiency gains is on improving **open-circuit voltage (Voc)**.
*   **Small Area Limitation:** Certified PCEs >20% are typically measured on very small areas (0.05-0.2 cm²). Upscaling to >1 cm² often shows non-uniform layers with spin-coating, and efficiencies up to 19.7% have been achieved for >1 cm² devices.
*   **Device Configuration for Large Area:** Requires changes to minimize resistance for charge transport.

#### **D. Device Photophysics**
*   **Charge Harvesting:** Hole-selective or electron-selective contacts collect carriers.
*   **Exciton Dissociation:** Not required due to low exciton binding energy compared to thermal energy.
*   **High Absorption Coefficient:** Perovskites have a high absorption coefficient (>10^5 cm^-1) due to direct bandgap transitions.
*   **Photocurrent (Jsc) Optimization:** Already high, can only be slightly increased.
*   **Ionic Defects & Hysteresis (Fig. 2B):** Intrinsic defects (e.g., I- ions) move under electric field, screening it, causing slow response to voltage changes and hysteresis in J-V curves.
    *   **Minimizing Hysteresis:** Immobilize ionic charge or increase carrier transport/extraction.
*   **Recombination:** Lost charges. Low recombination losses indicated by high Voc relative to bandgap.
    *   **Nonradiative Recombination:** Dominates over radiative. Influenced by bulk defects, surfaces, interfaces, grain boundaries, and impurities.
    *   **Voc Improvement:** Increasing nonradiative lifetime (towards 10 µs) and optimizing FF.
*   **Bandgap Tuning (Fig. 2D, E):** Ideal bandgap for solar spectrum is 1.1-1.4 eV.
    *   **Halide Mixing:** Tuning bandgap by mixing halides (Br, I) can cause segregation, forming undesired recombination centers.
    *   **Sn-Pb Compounds:** Can achieve lower bandgaps, but Sn2+ easily oxidizes to Sn4+.

#### **E. Perovskite Material Instability & Halide Segregation**
*   **Halide Mixing:** Increasing Br content to increase bandgap (e.g., for Si/perovskite tandems) can lead to halide segregation (distinct Br and I domains). This causes recombination centers and affects stability.
*   **MA Cation Volatility:** MA is thermally unstable at 85°C and degrades under moisture/heat. However, MAPbI3 can be light-stable.

#### **F. Cations Enable Perovskite Black-Phase Stabilization (Fig. 3)**
*   **FA-based Perovskites:** FAPbI3 is more thermally stable and has a narrower bandgap than MAPbI3, promising higher theoretical efficiencies.
    *   **Challenge:** FAPbI3 tends to form a photoinactive "yellow" phase at room temperature.
    *   **Solution:** Double-cation CsFA mixtures suppressed yellow-phase and halide segregation.
*   **Multication Engineering (Fig. 3A):** Complex mixtures (Rb, Cs, MA, FA + Br, I) improve reproducibility and achieve high PCEs (e.g., 21.6%).
    *   **Tolerance Factor (Fig. 3B):** An empirical measure (t) for lattice distortion, 0.8-1.0 is ideal for photoactive black phase. Cs, MA, FA fall within this range. Other cations (Na, K, Rb, imidazolium, ethylamine, guanidinium) are generally too small or too large.
    *   **MAFA Mixtures:** Adding MA to FA-based perovskites helps stabilize the black phase and led to world record efficiencies.
    *   **CsMAFA Mixtures:** Adding Cs to MAFA suppresses detrimental yellow-phase impurities, especially without annealing, improving crystallization and room-temperature processing.
*   **Rb-modified Perovskites:** Rb (close to tolerance factor limit) can be used in multication approaches (RbFA, RbMAFA, RbCsFA, RbCsMAFA) for new prospective materials.
*   **Larger Molecules/2D-3D Perovskites:** Adding large molecules to 3D perovskites results in 2D-3D structures (metal layers separated by larger cations), showing promise for stability but still trailing in performance.

#### **G. PSC Stability Under Working Conditions (Fig. 4)**
*   **Market Reference:** Crystalline silicon solar cells (0.5% degradation per year, 25-year warranty). PSCs must achieve similar levels (0.25-0.5% losses per year).
*   **Extrinsic Degradation Factors (Irreversible):**
    *   **High Temperature/Constant Illumination:** Causes crystallization of organic HTMs (spiro-OMeTAD), leading to interaction with metal electrode and perovskite (e.g., Gold migration, Fig. 4A).
    *   **Solutions:** Carbon electrodes (thermally stable, no interaction), robust polymeric HTLs (PTAA maintained 95% efficiency after 500 hours at 85°C, Fig. 4B).
    *   **Hole Conductor Dopant Migration:** Lithium salts migrating through perovskite layer.
    *   **UV Light:** Detrimental as absorbed by TiO2 ETL, initiating chemical degradation.
    *   **Solutions:** Wide band gap ETLs (superior UV stability, Fig. 4C), UV filters, UV fluorophores (downconverting UV to visible light).
    *   **Moisture:** Severely influences stability.
    *   **Solutions:** Proper encapsulation (e.g., elastomeric polymer EVA, Fig. 4D), ITO electrodes as moisture barriers.

*   **Intrinsic Degradation Factors (Reversible):**
    *   **Ionic Movement:** Leads to fast (seconds-minutes) and slow (minutes-hours, Fig. 4E) performance degradation.
    *   **Hysteresis (fast) & Reversible Losses (slow):** PCE decreases during aging but recovers after dark storage (attributed to lattice deformation, halide migration, or cation migration).
    *   **Impact on Long-Term Stability:** Mild reversible losses could still be an obstacle.

*   **Testing Protocols:**
    *   **Shelf Test (dark storage) vs. MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) vs. Outdoor Tests:** Different tests yield different performance metrics.
    *   **Hysteresis Impact:** Stability curves from periodically collected J-V curves can look better than continuous MPPT.
    *   **Recommendation:** Adopt conventional MPPT for perovskite-specific phenomena to simulate field conditions.
    *   **Current Issue:** Existing Si/organic PV accelerated testing conditions may be too strict or too mild for PSCs, requiring reassessment.

#### **H. Opportunities and Challenges**
*   **Advances:** Borrowing expertise from other fields, new applications (X-ray detection), impressive properties (long-lived hot carriers, low loss in potential).
*   **Main Focus:** Long-term stability is *the key issue* impeding rapid commercialization.
*   **Future Needs:**
    *   More robust testing procedures (MPPT, light soaking, high temperatures, humidity, outdoor field testing).
    *   Correlate accelerated indoor testing to real working conditions.
    *   Offset both intrinsic and extrinsic degradation.
    *   Achieve 20-year lifetime with minimal degradation to compete in the power market.
