### **1. Executive Summary / Main Purpose of the Paper**
This review paper addresses the critical issue of **poor stability** as the primary barrier to the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), despite their rapidly increasing efficiencies (exceeding 20%). The authors emphasize the need for a **holistic view** of device stability, considering the interdependent relationships between all layers: the perovskite absorber, electron transport layers (ETL), hole transport layers (HTL), buffer layers, and electrodes. It comprehensively discusses degradation mechanisms related to moisture, UV light, and temperature, alongside other factors like encapsulation, hysteresis, and the necessity for standardized testing protocols compliant with IEC 61646. Future research should focus on improving intrinsic absorber stability, optimizing device geometry, and developing durable encapsulants.

### **2. Key Topics & Important Points**

#### **A. Introduction**
*   **Promise of PSCs:** Rapid efficiency increase (>20%), compatible with cheap solution processing, low-cost.
*   **Commercial Barrier:** Poor stability, specifically in meeting IEC 61646 testing standards for environmental stability.
*   **Holistic View:** Instability is not just the perovskite layer but an interdependent issue involving all device layers (absorber, ETL, HTL, buffer, electrodes) and interfaces.
*   **Key Focus:** Intrinsic stability of absorber, device geometry, durable encapsulants to prevent moisture ingress.

#### **B. Stability of the Perovskite Layer**
1.  **Moisture (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4):**
    *   **Primary Cause:** Water is the main catalyst for irreversible degradation of CH3NH3PbI3.
    *   **Decomposition Pathway:** CH3NH3PbI3 + H2O → CH3NH3I(aq) + PbI2(s) → CH3NH2(aq) + HI(aq), and 4HI(aq) + O2 → 2I2(s) + 2H2O.
    *   **By-products:** PbI2 is water-soluble, posing eco-toxicological problems if released.
    *   **Intermediate Hydrated Compound:** (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O can form, causing significant reduction in film absorption, but not affecting charge carrier dynamics on a short timescale.
    *   **Impact:** Rapid reduction in absorption, color change from dark brown to pale yellow. Degradation rate is highly dependent on Relative Humidity (RH).
2.  **UV Light (Fig. 5):**
    *   **Degradation:** UV light causes degradation, especially when TiO2 ETL is present, as TiO2 is susceptible to UV-induced degradation.
    *   **Mechanism:** Electrons injected into TiO2 become trapped in deep-lying unoccupied sites, leading to rapid deterioration of charge collection efficiency.
    *   **Observation:** Encapsulated devices can degrade *more rapidly* than non-encapsulated ones under UV light, due to enhanced trapping in TiO2.
    *   **Solutions:**
        *   Pacify trap states in TiO2.
        *   Prevent UV light from reaching TiO2 (e.g., UV filters).
        *   Replace TiO2 with other materials.
        *   Sb2S3 blocking layer at TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface to block photocatalysis.
3.  **Temperature (Fig. 6, Fig. 7):**
    *   **Decomposition:** Elevated temperatures cause CH3NH3PbI3 to decompose to PbI2, releasing volatile CH3NH2 and HI.
    *   **Dependence:** Decomposition temperature depends on film formation technique and measurement conditions (e.g., vacuum level).
    *   **Interface Instability:** ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 interface accelerates thermal decomposition (less thermally stable than TiO2 interface). This is attributed to the more basic nature of ZnO, potentially causing deprotonation of the methylammonium cation. Heat treating ZnO can improve stability but reduces device performance.
4.  **Attempts to Improve Intrinsic Stability (Fig. 9, Fig. 12, Fig. 13):**
    *   **Halide Substitution (e.g., Br for I):** CH3NH3Pb(I1-xBrx)3 showed improved stability for higher Br content (x=0.2, 0.29), attributed to reduced lattice constant and transition from tetragonal to cubic phase. (Fig. 9)
    *   **Pb-free Alternatives:** Sn-based perovskites (CH3NH3SnI3, CH3NH3Sn(I3-xBrx)3) are explored but suffer from rapid Sn2+ oxidation in ambient air. Layered 2D perovskites ((C6H5(CH2)2NH3)2(CH3NH3)2[Pb3I10]) and ternary halides (Cs3Sb2I9) show improved moisture stability but generally low PCE.
    *   **Formamidinium (FAI):** FAI-based perovskites (FAPbI3) have lower bandgap (1.48 eV) and improved charge transport. FAI films were initially thought to be thermally stable up to 150 °C (unlike MAI at 55 °C), but are susceptible to moisture-induced degradation (pinholes).
    *   **Cs Hybridization:** Incorporating Cs (e.g., FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3) improves moisture and thermal stability and reduces recombination, but devices still degrade within an hour. (Fig. 12)
    *   **Additives (e.g., 4-ABPACI):** Butylphosphonic acid 4-ammonium chloride (4-ABPACI) can cross-link adjacent perovskite grains, forming a smoother capping layer and improving infiltration into TiO2, significantly hindering moisture-induced decomposition (stability maintained for 1000h). (Fig. 13)

#### **C. Stability of Other Layers**
1.  **Electron Transport Layer (ETL):**
    *   **TiO2:** Most common. Defects (oxygen vacancies, titanium interstitials) cause deep trap states, reducing performance. Al-doping of TiO2 can passivate traps and increase conductivity, improving performance and stability.
    *   **SnO2:** Alternative to TiO2 (lower processing temp 200°C). Planar devices with SnO2 show significantly better stability than TiO2-based devices (stable for 700h in ambient air), possibly due to PbI2 passivation at the SnO2/perovskite interface.
2.  **Hole Transport Layer (HTL) (Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16):**
    *   **Spiro-OMeTAD:** Most common. Requires additives (TBP, Li-TFSI) to improve conductivity, but these additives can degrade the perovskite layer. Gaseous by-products from perovskite decomposition can migrate through soft Spiro-OMeTAD, forming voids and increasing series resistance (Rs).
    *   **Polymeric HTLs (P3HT, PTAA):** More robust to temperature and moisture than Spiro-OMeTAD. P3HT/SWNT-PC HTL showed remarkable water resistance (PCE dropped minimally after exposure to running water). (Fig. 15)
    *   **Thin PT Film:** Electrochemical polymerization yields thin polythiophene film (5nm), highly efficient (15.4%), stable over 816h.
    *   **Inorganic HTLs (NiOx, CuI, CuSCN):** Show better environmental stability than organic HTLs. Cu-doped NiOx achieves high PCE (15.4%) and superior stability compared to PEDOT:PSS (retained 90% efficiency after 240h vs. PEDOT:PSS <50% after 144h). (Fig. 16)
    *   **Dopant-free HTLs:** TTF-1 (tetrathiafulvalene derivative) showed improved stability due to absence of moisture-absorbing Li salt. DR3TBDTT (conductive oligothiophene) offers high intrinsic hole mobility and hydrophobicity.
3.  **Buffer Layer (Al2O3) (Fig. 17):**
    *   **Function:** Al2O3 nanoparticles between perovskite and HTL.
    *   **Benefits:** Reduces HTL thickness, improves FF, and prevents migration of metal from the top contact to the perovskite layer (a source of shunt pathways), significantly improving device stability. (Fig. 17)
4.  **Electrode:**
    *   **Gold (Au):** Most common for high efficiency, but prohibitively expensive.
    *   **Silver (Ag):** Alternative, but worse environmental stability than gold. Exposure to humidity leads to AgI formation (yellowish color), reducing efficiency. Mechanism involves water diffusion, perovskite decomposition (forming iodine-containing species), migration of iodine to Ag, and AgI formation. (Fig. 18)
    *   **Carbon Ink:** Ideal choice (low cost, environmental impact, no Ag recycling issues). Can be used in HTL-free, triple-layer devices (TiO2/ZrO2/Carbon) with printed carbon electrodes, providing protection from moisture. High processing temperatures (450°C) for these structures are a drawback for mass production. Flexible carbon electrodes (CNT fibers, thermoplastic carbon film) demonstrated good stability and flexibility.

#### **D. Other Factors**
1.  **Encapsulation:**
    *   **Necessity:** Crucial for protecting perovskite from moisture decomposition for commercialization.
    *   **Methods:** UV curable epoxy resin with glass cover slips for small devices. Roll-to-roll processes with PET barrier foils and edge sealing for flexible modules. Conductive copper tape as a top electrode can act as a moisture barrier.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly improves stability, particularly in humid conditions.
2.  **Effect of Hysteresis and Ion Migration on Stability (Fig. 21):**
    *   **Hysteresis:** J-V curves show hysteresis (PV parameters depend on scan direction/rate). Causes: grain size/boundaries, defect states, trap trapping at interfaces, ion migration.
    *   **Ion Migration:** Diffusion of intrinsic ionic defects (e.g., iodide ion vacancies, MA/Pb vacancies) within the crystal structure. Can counteract overall photovoltage, hinder efficiency, and impact long-term stability. Photochemical decomposition of PbX2 from 1960s already showed ion migration.
    *   **Passivation:** C60/fullerene passivation eliminates photocurrent hysteresis by interacting with defective regions at grain boundaries. Zr-doped TiO2 coupled with pyridine molecules reduces hysteresis. SnO2 ETLs show less hysteresis than TiO2.
    *   **Research Need:** Exact nature of mobile ionic species and activation energies, and the impact of hysteresis/ion migration on long-term stability, need further research.
3.  **Standard Testing Protocols:**
    *   **Current Issue:** Variability of testing conditions (e.g., "ambient" RH values) hinders comparability and progress.
    *   **Need:** Comparable measurement protocols for PSCs, similar to ISOS protocols for OPV or IEC 61646 standards for thin-film modules. These protocols should consider PSC-specific aspects: perovskite absorber decomposition, mesoscopic scaffold, and measurement-induced hysteresis.
    *   **IEC 61646 Compliance:** PSCs must comply for commercial viability, requiring significant improvements in moisture and thermal decomposition resistance.
4.  **Comparison of Solid State DSSC and Perovskites:**
    *   **Evolution:** PSCs evolved from DSSC technology.
    *   **Difference:** DSSCs traditionally use liquid electrolytes (stability issue) and are separate sensitizers; PSCs are more like thin-film semiconductors (no inorganic scaffold or liquid electrolyte).
    *   **Stability:** Solid-state DSSCs (with polymer gel electrolytes) achieve impressive stability (e.g., 96.7% initial efficiency after 1000h) but generally lower efficiency (13%). This highlights that replacing liquid electrolytes improves stability.

#### **E. Conclusion (Fig. 22)**
*   **Outlook:** PSCs have the potential to revolutionize PV.
*   **Key Issues (Fig. 22):** Intrinsic stability of perovskite layer, extrinsic effects on other layers, device geometry, and standardized testing protocols.
*   **Primary Concern:** Inherent instability of CH3NH3PbI3 to moisture.
*   **Future Research:** Improve intrinsic stability of absorber, careful device geometry design, durable encapsulant materials. Needs a "whole system" approach.

### **3. Viva Preparation: Potential Questions & How to Answer**

**General Questions:**

1.  **What is the central argument of this paper regarding PSC commercialization?**
    *   *Answer:* Despite high efficiencies, poor stability is the main barrier. Commercialization requires addressing stability holistically across all device layers and interfaces, and meeting IEC standards.
2.  **Why is it important to view the PSC device as a "whole system" when discussing stability?**
    *   *Answer:* Because the stability of each layer (absorber, ETL, HTL, buffer, electrode) and their interfaces are interdependent. Degradation in one part can accelerate degradation in others.
3.  **What are the IEC 61646 standards, and why are they relevant to PSCs?**
    *   *Answer:* They are international standards for environmental stability testing of thin-film modules. PSCs must comply with these standards to qualify for market entry and achieve commercial viability.

**Perovskite Layer Stability:**

4.  **Describe the chemical degradation pathway of CH3NH3PbI3 in the presence of moisture (refer to Fig. 2). What are the by-products, and why are they a concern?**
    *   *Answer:* (As described in section 2.1). PbI2 is water-soluble and poses eco-toxicological problems if released.
5.  **How does UV light cause degradation in PSCs, particularly when a TiO2 ETL is used? What observations support this?**
    *   *Answer:* TiO2 is susceptible to UV-induced photocatalysis. Electrons injected into TiO2 get trapped, reducing charge collection. Encapsulated devices can degrade faster under UV, as evidenced by PCE measurements (Fig. 5).
6.  **What role does temperature play in perovskite degradation? Discuss the issue with ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 interfaces.**
    *   *Answer:* Elevated temperatures cause decomposition (CH3NH3PbI3 to PbI2). ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 interfaces are less thermally stable than TiO2 interfaces, possibly due to ZnO's basicity causing deprotonation of the MA cation.

**Intrinsic Stability Improvement Attempts:**

7.  **How has halide substitution (e.g., Br for I) been used to improve intrinsic perovskite stability? What are the mechanisms behind this?**
    *   *Answer:* Higher Br content (in CH3NH3Pb(I1-xBrx)3) leads to improved stability, attributed to a reduced lattice constant and a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic (Fig. 9).
8.  **Discuss the use of Cs hybridization (e.g., FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3) for improving PSC stability.**
    *   *Answer:* Cs incorporation improves moisture and thermal stability and reduces recombination by reducing trap state density, though devices still degrade within an hour. (Fig. 12)
9.  **What is the role of additives like 4-ABPACI in enhancing perovskite stability (refer to Fig. 13)?**
    *   *Answer:* 4-ABPACI cross-links adjacent perovskite grains, forms a smoother capping layer, improves infiltration, and significantly hinders moisture-induced decomposition. (Fig. 13)

**Stability of Other Layers:**

10. **Compare TiO2 and SnO2 as ETLs in terms of stability. Which is better, and why?**
    *   *Answer:* SnO2 is generally better for stability. It allows lower processing temperatures and leads to more stable devices than TiO2-based devices, possibly due to PbI2 passivation at the SnO2/perovskite interface. TiO2 is susceptible to UV degradation and defects.
11. **What are the stability issues associated with Spiro-OMeTAD as an HTL, and what alternatives are being explored?**
    *   *Answer:* Additives in Spiro-OMeTAD can degrade perovskite. Gaseous by-products from perovskite decomposition can form voids in Spiro-OMeTAD, increasing series resistance. Alternatives include robust polymeric HTLs (P3HT, PTAA), inorganic HTLs (Cu-doped NiOx, CuSCN), and dopant-free HTLs (TTF-1, DR3TBDTT).
12. **Explain the mechanism of Ag electrode degradation in PSCs (refer to Fig. 18). Why is carbon considered an ideal alternative?**
    *   *Answer:* Ag degrades by forming AgI in the presence of moisture and iodine-containing species (from perovskite decomposition), which changes the electrode to a yellowish color. Carbon is ideal due to low cost, environmental impact, no Ag recycling issues, and protective properties (moisture barrier). (Fig. 18)

**Other Factors:**

13. **Why is encapsulation critical for PSC commercialization, and what are some common methods used?**
    *   *Answer:* Encapsulation is crucial to protect the perovskite layer from moisture, which is its primary degradation factor. Methods include UV curable epoxy resin with glass coverslips, PET barrier foils with edge sealing for flexible devices, and conductive copper tape acting as a moisture barrier.
14. **Discuss the causes of hysteresis in PSCs and how ion migration contributes to stability concerns.**
    *   *Answer:* Hysteresis is caused by grain size/boundaries, defect states, charge trapping, and ion migration. Ion migration (e.g., iodide vacancies) can counteract the device's photovoltage and significantly impact long-term operational stability.
15. **What are the limitations of current PSC stability testing protocols, and what is needed for future development?**
    *   *Answer:* Current protocols suffer from variability in testing conditions (e.g., "ambient" RH). Future development requires standardized protocols adapted for PSCs, considering their unique decomposition mechanisms, mesoscopic scaffolds, and hysteresis, to allow for comparable research and compliance with IEC 61646.
